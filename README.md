# chip8.js
A CHIP-8 emulator written in pure JavaScript with support for both original and modern ROMs.

## Usage

Open the index.html in your choice of a web browser, and open a .ch8 rom using the file input. If a ROM is not working as expected, try to change the implementation.

Keypad is as follows:

`1 2 3 4`

`Q W E R`

`A S D F`

`Z X C V`

The frontend in this repository is intended as a proof of concept. The main project is the .js file itself.
